# RemotePunch

A geofenced remote attendance ("punching") web application built with
**ASP.NET Web Forms on .NET Framework 4.8**, C# and SQL Server.

Employees open one page on their phone, the browser reports where they are, and
the **server** decides whether that counts as being at work. Every punch is
stored with the raw sensor reading it came from, so an attendance report can
always be traced back to a coordinate, an accuracy radius, a device and a time.

---

## What it does

**Punching**

- One-tap punch in / punch out with automatic direction (the next punch is
  whichever one makes sense).
- Live location readout while the page is open: coordinates, accuracy, altitude,
  speed, heading, fix age and the number of readings taken.
- A map (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap) showing the employee, their accuracy circle
  and every geofence they may punch from.
- Optional selfie capture from the front camera, stored as evidence.
- A note field, required by the page when the employee is away from their site.
- Works on a flaky connection: a punch that fails to send is queued in the
  browser and retried, and an idempotency key stops the retry double-punching.

**Geo sensing and the geofence decision**

- Sites are circles: a centre and a radius in metres, picked on a map.
- Distance is computed with the haversine formula **on the server**, against
  the sites that employee is assigned to.
- Weak fixes can be forgiven by adding the reported accuracy to the radius,
  capped so a deliberately bad fix cannot swallow the neighbourhood.
- Fixes that are too inaccurate, or too old (cached GPS), are refused.

**Integrity checks** — every punch is scored, and the score decides accepted /
flagged / rejected:

| Finding | What it catches |
| --- | --- |
| `OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE` | Punching away from every assigned site |
| `LOW_ACCURACY` / `NO_ACCURACY_REPORTED` | A fix too vague to trust |
| `STALE_FIX` | A cached position replayed later |
| `IMPOSSIBLE_TRAVEL` | Two punches implying an impossible ground speed |
| `IDENTICAL_COORDINATES` | Byte-identical coordinates, the signature of a replayed fix |
| `SUSPICIOUS_FIX_SHAPE` | Perfect accuracy with no altitude, speed or heading |
| `DEVICE_CLOCK_SKEW` | A device clock well away from server time |
| `UNTRUSTED_DEVICE` | A phone or browser an administrator has not trusted |
| `GEOLOCATION_API_PATCHED` | The browser's geolocation function was not the native one |
| `OUTSIDE_SHIFT_HOURS` | A punch well outside the employee's shift |
| `FORWARDED_REQUEST` | The request arrived through a proxy |

**Administration**

- Dashboard: who punched today, how many punches, what was flagged or rejected.
- Review queue: every flagged punch with its map location, photo, findings and
  device, with approve / decline and a reviewer note.
- Employees: create, edit, roles (Employee / Manager / Admin), shift window,
  per-employee remote-punch and selfie policy, site assignment, password reset,
  lockout clearing.
- Sites: create and edit geofences on a map, with a live radius preview.
- Devices: trust, untrust or block a device fingerprint.
- Audit log: sign-ins, lockouts, punches, reviews, exports, admin edits, errors.
- Reports: daily attendance (first in, last out, hours worked, late minutes) and
  raw punch listings, both exportable to CSV.

## Getting it running

### Requirements

- Windows with IIS 8+ (or IIS Express / Visual Studio 2019+)
- .NET Framework 4.8
- SQL Server 2016 or newer (Express is fine)
- **HTTPS** — browsers refuse to share a location on a plain `http://` origin.
  `http://localhost` is the only exception, which is enough for development.

### 1. Database

```powershell
sqlcmd -S .\SQLEXPRESS -E -i database\01_Schema.sql
sqlcmd -S .\SQLEXPRESS -E -i database\02_SeedData.sql   # demo accounts, optional
```

The seed script creates three accounts, all of which must change their password
at first sign-in:

| Code | Password | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ADMIN001` | `Admin@12345` | Admin |
| `MGR001` | `Mgr@12345` | Manager |
| `EMP001` | `Emp@12345` | Employee |

**Delete or change these before the app is reachable by anyone else.**

### 2. Configure

Open `src/RemotePunch.Web/Web.config` and set:

- `<connectionStrings>` → your SQL Server instance.
- `App.TimeZoneId` → the Windows time-zone id for your local times
  (default `India Standard Time`).
- `Geo.*` and `Fraud.*` → how strict the geofence and the scoring should be.
  Every key is commented in place.
- In production also set `requireSSL="true"` on `<forms>` and `<httpCookies>`,
  and give `<machineKey>` explicit keys if you run more than one server.

### 3. Build and deploy

Open `RemotePunch.sln` in Visual Studio and press F5, or build and publish to
IIS:

```powershell
msbuild RemotePunch.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```

Then in IIS: point an application at `src/RemotePunch.Web`, give the app pool
(.NET CLR v4.0, integrated pipeline) **write access to `Uploads/Selfies`** and
read access to the rest, and bind an HTTPS certificate.

There are no NuGet packages to restore — the app uses only the framework.
Leaflet is loaded from a CDN and degrades gracefully to a hidden map; to run
fully offline, drop `leaflet.css` / `leaflet.js` into `Content/` and repoint the
two tags in `Punch.aspx` and `Admin/SiteEdit.aspx`.

### 4. First steps in the app

1. Sign in as the admin and change the password.
2. **Admin → Sites**: add your office, pick the centre on the map, set a radius.
3. **Admin → Employees**: add people, assign their sites, set shift hours, and
   decide who may punch remotely and who must send a photo.
4. Give everyone the HTTPS URL. On a phone, "Add to home screen" makes it behave
   like an app.

## How a punch is decided

```
browser  ──► watchPosition(), keeps the most accurate reading
         ──► POST /Api/Punch.ashx  { raw coords, accuracy, altitude, speed,
                                     heading, timestamp, device signals, note,
                                     optional photo, idempotency key }
server   ──► is this a replay of a request already recorded?      → return the original
         ──► are the coordinates usable? accurate enough? fresh?  → else Rejected
         ──► haversine distance to each assigned site             → nearest + inside?
         ──► compare against the previous punch (speed, repeats)
         ──► device known? blocked? trusted?
         ──► score every finding
         ──► Rejected | Flagged (queued for review) | Accepted
         ──► store the punch, the findings, the photo and an audit entry
```

The browser's own distance calculation is only used to draw the screen. If a
client lies about being inside a geofence, the server ignores it, because the
server recomputes everything from the coordinates.

## Security notes

- Passwords: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 120 000 iterations, 32-byte per-user salt, with
  the iteration count stored per row so it can be raised later.
- Sign-in throttling: configurable lockout after repeated failures, and the same
  error message whether the account exists or not.
- Every SQL statement is parameterised; no query is built by concatenating input.
- Forms authentication with an encrypted, signed ticket; role checks for the
  admin area live in `Web.config`, and every page re-checks on the server.
- The punch endpoint requires a custom header, which a cross-site form post
  cannot set, on top of a `SameSite=Lax` auth cookie.
- Selfies are stored outside the servable path and handed out only by
  `Api/Selfie.ashx`, which checks that the caller owns the punch or may review
  others'.
- CSV exports neutralise leading `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` so a note cannot become a
  spreadsheet formula.

### What this cannot do

Be straight with your users about this: **no browser-based system can prove a
location.** A rooted phone with a mock-location provider, a patched browser or a
crafted HTTP request can all present coordinates that never happened. What this
application does is make that *expensive and visible*: the fix has to be recent,
accurate, consistent with the previous punch, from a known device, and it is all
recorded. The findings table above is a detection aid, not a guarantee, which is
why flagged punches go to a human rather than being silently dropped.

Reverse geocoding (`Geocode.Provider`) is **off** by default. Turning it on
sends employee coordinates to OpenStreetMap or Google — check that against your
privacy obligations first, and note Nominatim's usage policy.

  Scripts/punch.js         client-side geo sensing, camera, offline queue
  Content/site.css         the whole stylesheet
  Uploads/Selfies/         stored photos (kept out of source control)
```

`Services/PunchService.cs` is the file to read first: it is where a location
reading becomes an attendance record.
